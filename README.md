Whisper App is an AI-powered, voice-first communication platform designed to break barriers in interaction. It allows users to speak naturally, get real-time transcriptions, translations, and even AI-powered responses. Inspired by the need for seamless, human-like communication, Whisper leverages speech recognition, natural language understanding, and voice synthesis.

The goal is to make communication more inclusive, fast, and accessible – especially for people who face challenges in typing, reading, or language differences.

🔹 Key Features

🎙 Speech-to-Text (STT)

Uses OpenAI Whisper (or AssemblyAI) to convert speech into text with high accuracy.

Can be saved as notes for later.

🌍 Multilingual Support

Translates spoken language into the listener’s preferred language.

Helps in cross-language communication.

🤖 AI-Powered Responses

Integrated with GPT model for generating contextual replies.

User can interact by voice only (no typing needed).

🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Converts AI or user messages back to natural voice.

Uses Google TTS / ElevenLabs for realistic audio.

📂 History & Notes

Stores past conversations securely.

Can export notes or transcripts.

🔹 Tech Stack

Frontend (Mobile): Flutter (cross-platform Android/iOS)

Backend: Python (Flask / FastAPI)

APIs:

Whisper / AssemblyAI (Speech Recognition)

GPT (Language Understanding & Response Generation)

ElevenLabs / gTTS (Text-to-Speech)

Database: Firebase / SQLite (for storing conversations & user data)

Hosting: Firebase / AWS

🔹 How It Works (Flow)

User speaks into the app.

Audio → processed by Whisper (STT) → text.

Text sent to AI model (for understanding or response).

AI generates reply → converted into speech (TTS).

Both text + audio stored in history.

👉 This creates a voice-first conversational loop.
